# Introduction
- **Orthodox Canonical Form:**\
Going forward, our classes should adhere to the Orthodox Canonical Form unless otherwise specified. This means each class must include the following four member functions:
	- `Default constructor`
	- `Copy constructor`
	- `Copy assignment operator`
	- `Destructor`
